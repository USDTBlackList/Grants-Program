## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

In April 2023, we launched the [**USDT Blacklist**](https://www.usdtblacklist.com/) project to help Web3 users identify high-risk addresses and avoid on-chain risks. 

Now, we plan to build a decentralized Web3 security community. Through the DAO community's philosophy of fairness, transparency, and autonomy, engage more individuals, companies, and organizations to build and maintain the world's most reliable Web3 risk data source. Enable every user to contribute to the security of the Web3 ecosystem.

### Project Details

1. **Background for the Project**

Blockchain transactions, while promoting transparency and decentralization, introduce inherent risks like fraud, hacks, and illicit activities. The irreversible nature of these transactions and the pseudonymous identities on the blockchain pose challenges in effectively mitigating these risks. With the blockchain ecosystem expanding, there is a heightened demand for tools and systems to bolster security and safeguard users.

To address these challenges, **USDT Blacklist** was conceived to provide a centralized solution for risk identification and mitigation, ensuring a secure environment for all participants. Central to its operation is the collection of risk data from diverse sources, including blockchain analytics, external intelligence sources, and community feedback. Automated threat assessments are complemented by human oversight to ensure precision and confidence.

Services are disseminated through multiple channels, striking a balance between security, transparency, and user accessibility. This approach blends technological innovation with judicious decision-making to fortify the ecosystem. By proactively managing risks, **USDT Blacklist** enhances the safety and reliability of the ecosystem, nurturing trust and sustainable growth within the blockchain domain.

1. **Advancing Decentralization**

After over a year of centralized operations, we realized that relying exclusively on our team is insufficient to comprehensively address the governance of on-chain risks. To involve more individuals in safeguarding Web3 security and to achieve transparent and equitable risk management, we decided to transition to a decentralized governance model via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

Through the Web3 Security DAO (W3SD), our goal is to establish a global Web3 security community where individuals, companies, and organizations can become part of the governance structure. Together, we will develop and maintain the world's most reliable Web3 risk data source, empowering every user to contribute to the security of the Web3 ecosystem.

**2.1 Governance**

**Benefits of DAO Governance**

- **Democratized Decision-Making:** All DAO members can propose and vote, enabling collective wisdom to drive decisions.
- **Transparency and Credibility:** Governance records are stored on-chain, making processes traceable and tamper-proof.
- **Efficiency and Automation:** Smart contracts automatically execute voting outcomes, reducing manual intervention and delays.
- **Inclusivity:** Anyone meeting minimum requirements can join as a DAO member and participate in governance.
- **Incentive Mechanism:** Token-based rewards encourage greater participation, boosting community activity and data quality.

**Principles of DAO Governance**

- **On-Chain Proposals:** DAO members can submit proposals, such as marking an address as high-risk.
- **Voting Mechanism:** Once a proposal is submitted, eligible DAO members vote to support or oppose it.
- **Smart Contract Execution:** After voting concludes, smart contracts execute the decision, updating risk records and distributing rewards accordingly.

![new-process.png](https://statics-hg32f.usdtblacklist.com/flow-2.png)

By embracing DAO governance, the community shifts from passive recipients of centralized services to active creators and managers of risk data.

**2.2. Web3 Voting**

- **Enhanced Security:** Cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms protect the integrity of voting results.
- **Transparency:** All proposals, votes, and results are publicly accessible, eliminating opaque operations.
- **High Efficiency:** Smart contracts automate execution, reducing costs and time.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Proposals and voting outcomes can be updated in realtime, accelerating decision-making.
- **Fairness:** Token holdings and participation balance voting power, ensuring democratic governance.
- **Global Accessibility:** On-chain voting removes geographic barriers, fostering worldwide participation and collaboration.

Through decentralized governance and incentive models, W3SD unites Web3 users globally to build a secure, transparent, and trustworthy on-chain ecosystem.

**Incentive Rules**

- If a proposal passes, both the proposer and supportive voters receive rewards.
- If a proposal fails, only supportive voters are rewarded, discouraging frivolous proposals.

**2.3 Governance Tokens**

- **Voting Weight:** Each token represents one vote. Members holding more tokens have greater influence, aligning rights with responsibilities.
- **Incentive Mechanism:** Tokens serve as rewards to encourage active participation in proposals, voting, and data submission.
- **Economic Sustainability:** Token distribution and consumption (e.g., governance fees) ensure the long-term viability of the community.
- **Access Control:** Holding tokens is a prerequisite for governance participation, fostering a community of engaged and contributing members.

**Advantages of Governance Tokens**

- **Fairness:** Token holdings determine voting weight, preventing governance monopolization.
- **Value Creation:** Token circulation and appreciation are directly tied to community growth.
- **Resource Allocation:** Token-based rewards attract developers, data contributors, and security researchers.
